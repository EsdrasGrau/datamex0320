# Introduction

For this project I took all the sales transactions of 2019 of certain Japanese company (one location) and decided to add weather historical data and national holidays info to each transaction.

You will find different files for this web project.
**Jupyter notebooks**
Each of the notebooks was made for the individual activities, where you can see in detail

1. Scrapping
2. API
3. Transactions cleaning
4. and merge process of the 3 Data Frames plus basic reporting.

**CSV Files**
For each step you will find a CSV file being the final_set.csv the final result.
Transactions2019 - Original set
Weather - Web Scrapping
Holidays - API
Clean Set - Original set cleaned
Final Set - Merged Data Frame with all the previous info and complete clean.

P.S. You will see some Japanese during the coding process plus the results. It will be easy to understand I made it semi-bilingual.
