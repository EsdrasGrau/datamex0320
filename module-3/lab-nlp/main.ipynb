    "## Text Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Text cleaning is also called text cleasning. The goal is to clean up the messy real-world textual data in order to improve the text analysis accuracy at later steps. For generic textual data sources, we usually need to fix the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Missing values\n",
    "* Special characters\n",
    "* Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "For web data, we need to additinally fix:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTML tags\n",
    "* JavaScripts\n",
    "* CSS\n",
    "* URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "Case by case, there may also be special problems we need to fix for certain types of data. For instance, for Twitter tweets data we need to fix hashtags and the Twitter handler including a *@* sign and Twitter usernames.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we also need to convert the texts to lower cases so that when we anaylize the words later, NLTK will not think *Ironhack* and *ironhack* mean different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the above are the general steps to clean up data for NLP analysis. In specific cases, not all those steps apply. For example, if you are analyzing textual data on history, you probably don't want to remove numbers because numbers (such as year and time) are important in history. Besides, if you are doing something like network analysis on web data, you may want to retain hyperlinks so that you will be able to extract the outgoing links in the next step. Sometimes you may also need to do some cleaning first, then extract some features, then do more cleaning, then extract more features. You'll have to make these judgments by yourself case by case. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are keeping things relatively simple so **you only need to clean up special characters, numbers, and URLs**. Let's say you have the following messy string to clean up:"

    "\n",
    "## Stemming and Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do stemming and lemmatization in the same step because otherwise we'll have to loop each token lists twice. You have learned in the previous challenge that stemming and lemmatization are similar but have different purposes for text normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stemming reduces words to their root forms (stems) even if the stem itself is not a valid word**. For instance, *token*, *tokenize*, and *tokenization* will be reduced to the same stem - *token*. And *change*, *changed*, *changing* will be reduced to *chang*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLTK, there are three stemming libraries: [*Porter*](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/porter.html), [*Snowball*](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/snowball.html), and [*Lancaster*](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/lancaster.html). The difference among the three is the agressiveness with which they perform stemming. Porter is the most gentle stemmer that preserves the word's original form if it has doubts. In contrast, Lancaster is the most aggressive one that sometimes produces wrong outputs. And Snowball is in between. **In most cases you will use either Porter or Snowball**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemmatization differs from stemming in that lemmatization cares about whether the reduced form belongs to the target language and it often requires the context (i.e. POS or parts-of-speech) in order to perform the correct transformation**. For example, the [*Word Net lemmatizer* in NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/stem/wordnet.html) yields different results with and without being told that *was* is a verb:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    ">>> lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n",
    ">>> lemmatizer.lemmatize('was')\n",
    "'wa'\n",
    ">>> lemmatizer.lemmatize('runs', pos='v')\n",
    "'be'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Jupyter Notebook, import the necessary libraries and define a function called `stem_and_lemmatize` that performs both stemming and lemmatization on a list of words. Don't worry about the POS part of lemmatization for now.\n",

    "def stem_and_lemmatize(l):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "## Stop Words Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop Words are the most commonly used words in a language that don't contribute to the main meaning of the texts. Examples of English stop words are `i`, `me`, `is`, `and`, `the`, `but`, and `here`. We want to remove stop words from analysis because otherwise stop words will take the overwhelming portion in our tokenized word list and the NLP algorithms will have problems in identifying the truely important words.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK has a `stopwords` package that allows us to import the most common stop words in over a dozen langauges including English, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Italian, etc. These are the bare minimum stop words (100-150 words in each language) that can get beginners started. Some other NLP packages such as [*stop-words*](https://pypi.org/project/stop-words/) and [*wordcloud*](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/generated/wordcloud.WordCloud.html) provide bigger lists of stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in your Jupyter Notebook, create a function called `remove_stopwords` that loop through a list of words that have been stemmed and lemmatized to check and remove stop words. Return a new list where stop words have been removed.\n",
